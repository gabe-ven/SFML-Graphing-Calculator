# SFML Graphing Calculator

## <ins> Gabriel Venezia </ins>

## Description:
The SFML Graphing Calculator is a desktop application developed in C++ using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). Designed for visually plotting mathematical functions, this tool combines efficient computational capabilities with an interactive graphical interface.

## Key Features:
- Function Plotting: Supports linear, quadratic, polynomial, trigonometric, and exponential functions, allowing users to graph equations like sin(x) and x^2.
- Interactive Interface: Users can pan and zoom the graph with key controls, offering a seamless exploration of different scales and regions.
- Custom Input: Input mathematical expressions dynamically using an on-screen text box or predefined presets for common functions.
- Real-Time Updates: Automatically updates graphs as users modify parameters, providing immediate feedback.
- History Bar: Includes a history feature that stores previously graphed functions. Users can click on any entry in the history bar to quickly reload and view past graphs.
